# Enhanced Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification

## Project Overview

The "Enhanced Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification" project utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately classify images of cats and dogs. Leveraging the popular Kaggle dataset from a previous homework assignment, this project explores advanced data preprocessing and model optimization strategies to improve classification performance beyond the baseline established in HW 3.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

- **Dataset Download:** The Cats and Dogs dataset from Kaggle, initially used in HW 3, is downloaded and prepared for preprocessing.
- **Preprocessing Steps:** Following the procedures outlined in HW 3, the dataset undergoes a series of preprocessing steps including normalization, resizing, and augmentation to create a robust dataset for training the neural network.

### 2. Model Development and Training

- **Neural Network Architecture:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is selected for its efficacy in image classification tasks. The model architecture is designed to extract and learn the complex features from the images of cats and dogs.
- **Training:** The model is trained on the preprocessed images, utilizing techniques such as batch normalization and dropout to enhance learning efficiency and prevent overfitting.

### 3. Model Evaluation and Optimization

- **Evaluation:** After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set to gauge its classification accuracy.
- **Optimization:** Based on the initial evaluation results, further optimizations are applied to the model. This may include adjustments to the learning rate, model architecture, and training procedure to improve accuracy and reduce loss.

### 4. Deployment

- **Final Model:** The optimized model is prepared for deployment, where it can be used to classify new images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.
- **User Interface:** An optional user interface can be developed, allowing users to upload images and receive instant classification results.

### 5. Conclusion and Future Work

- **Summary:** The project concludes with a summary of the achieved improvements in classification accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the applied data preprocessing and model optimization techniques.
- **Future Directions:** Potential future enhancements are identified, such as experimenting with different neural network architectures (e.g., ResNet, Inception), incorporating additional datasets to increase the diversity of training images, and applying transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models for improved performance.
