# Enhanced Classification of Cats and Dogs

## Project Overview

The "Enhanced Classification of Cats and Dogs" project aims to improve upon traditional image classification methods by applying advanced neural network techniques. Leveraging the popular Kaggle dataset, this project demonstrates the power of deep learning in distinguishing between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to explore the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in accurately classifying images within the context of a highly relatable and visually distinct datasetâ€”cats and dogs. This work not only serves as an educational exploration of deep learning models but also showcases potential applications in areas such as digital media sorting, surveillance, and automated content moderation.

## Project Workflow

### Data Preparation
- Download the Kaggle dataset and perform initial data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as resizing images and normalizing pixel values.

### Model Development
- Design a CNN architecture tailored for image classification tasks, focusing on layers capable of capturing the intricacies in the images of cats and dogs.

### Training and Validation
- Split the dataset into training and validation sets to ensure the model is trained and evaluated effectively, implementing techniques to prevent overfitting.

### Evaluation
- Assess the model's performance on a separate test set, analyzing accuracy and loss metrics to gauge its classification capability.

### Optimization
- Apply hyperparameter tuning and experiment with different model architectures to refine the model's performance.
